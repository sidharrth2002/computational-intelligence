### The Set Covering ðŸ“” Problem Using Genetic Algorithms

> Sidharrth Nagappan, 2022

In this notebook, we will take a GA approach to solving the set-covering problem. As a background, let's assume we have 500 potential lists that should form a complete subset.

The final product should be a list of 0s and 1s that indicate which lists should be included in the final set. We use a genetic approach to obtain this list via:
1. Mutation: randomly change a 0 to a 1 or vice versa
2. Crossover: randomly select a point in the list and swap the values after that point
