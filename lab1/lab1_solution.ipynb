    "# Set Cover Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The set cover problem is a combinatorial optimization problem. The problem is to find the smallest set of sets that covers all elements of a given universe. For example, suppose we have a universe of 10 elements and 5 sets, each of which contains a subset of the universe. The goal is to find the smallest set of sets that covers all elements of the universe. \n",

    "Since the problem is NP-hard, we have to use a heuristic algorithm to solve and there exists no theoretically polynomial time algorithm.\n",
